                    <p class="info">
                        Written by Nathan Ballingrud, Treat tells the story of a seemingly perfect American town that
                        makes a deal with a mysterious outsider possessing supernatural powers to help it recover from
                        social turmoil. When the town falls behind on its payments, a trio of teenagers must unlock the
                        secret of his powers. Shipka will play protagonist and narrator Allie West.

                        on her shoulders: she has to be the adult in her family, but she’s still just a teenager coming
                        of age, and being able to play her and navigate her world is really fulfilling,” said Kiernan
                        Shipka. “‘Treat’ is a one-of-a-kind thrilling audio movie and story, and I’m so excited to be

                        exceptional originality, innovation, and storytelling,” said Chris Corcoran, Chief Content
                        Officer, Cadence13 and Executive Producer and Creator of C13Features. “Casting is one of the
                        most critical and important elements of this new audio movie experience from C13Features, and we
                        are so honored and excited to have Kiernan join us to play this incredible role of Allie—we
                        can’t wait to see her bring this pivotal character to life and help take ‘Treat’ to the level we
                        all believe it can go.”
